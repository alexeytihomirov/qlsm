// democut - a self-contained .dm_91 (Quake Live protocol 91) reader and cutter.
//
// This is the public surface src/features/demo_match.c is written against. It
// replaces a 1.3 MB vendored C++ copy of uberdemotools plus its extern "C"
// bridge; the API, its units and its failure modes are deliberately unchanged
// from that bridge, because demo_match.c's two-stage cut depends on every one
// of them. What DID change is that everything behind it is now plain C
// (gnu11), built with the same gcc the rest of minqlxtended is, with no C++
// toolchain and no third-party tree involved.
//
// Licensing: GPLv2, like minqlxtended itself. The protocol tables, the Huffman
// coder and the delta encoders are ports of id Software's Quake III Arena
// source (via wolfcamql, the Quake Live-capable engine that plays these files);
// the cut's message selection rules are a port of what the previously vendored
// uberdemotools did, which is itself id Tech 3's CL_Parse* with an output side.
//
// ===========================================================================
// THE CLOCK. Read this before touching a start/end value anywhere.
// ===========================================================================
//
// start_ms/end_ms are in the demo's *server time* clock: milliseconds since the
// map loaded on the server that recorded it. This is NOT wall-clock/epoch time
// and NOT "milliseconds since this recording started" - a real per-player
// capture from this pipeline had its first snapshot at 176550 and its last at
// 703000, i.e. the file begins 176.55 s of server uptime in, not at 0. The
// numbers to feed demo_cut() come from demo_scan() on the same file (first_ms /
// last_ms / arm_ms), never from wall time; job->seed_at in demo_match.c is wall
// time and is deliberately never used for this.
//
// end_ms = -1 does NOT mean "cut to the end of the file". It never did: the
// vendored cutter silently queued zero cuts for it and still reported success,
// leaving an empty output folder with nothing logged, which cost a live test
// run once. demo_cut() rejects start_ms >= end_ms outright (non-zero return,
// message in err_buf) so that failure mode cannot come back silently. To cut to
// the end of a file, pass that file's own last_ms from demo_scan(), or a large
// sentinel such as INT32_MAX - the window test clamps to the last snapshot that
// actually exists.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHAT A CUT ACTUALLY PRODUCES
// ===========================================================================
//
// A .dm_91 is a delta chain whose first message MUST be a gamestate, so a cut
// cannot simply copy bytes from the middle of a file. demo_cut() therefore
// walks the input, keeps the accumulated config strings and entity baselines,
// and at the first message whose server time falls inside [start_ms, end_ms]
// writes a SYNTHESIZED gamestate carrying that state - replacing that message's
// own content, which is why the first snapshot of a cut output is the one from
// the SECOND in-window message, not the first. Everything after it is
// re-encoded message by message until the first message past end_ms.
//
// Three properties of that output matter to callers:
//   - Message sequence numbers are the input's own, unchanged. A snapshot's
//     delta reference is relative ("this many messages back"), so renumbering
//     would repoint every one of them.
//   - Server command sequence numbers ARE renumbered from 0, because the
//     synthesized gamestate restarts that counter and the client refuses a gap.
//   - The first snapshot written is forced to be a full (non-delta) one, since
//     the frame it was delta-encoded against is not in the output.

//
// The capture side (upstream demos.c) never decodes message content: all it
// knows about a message is the netchan outgoingSequence it stamped into the
// file's 8-byte per-block header. demo_scan() closes that gap - it walks the
// framing itself, decodes each message, and reports the server times it finds,
// keyed by that same sequence number. The correlation is exact, not heuristic:
// the sequence number the caller reads out of the block header IS the
// messageNum the snapshot inside that block is stamped with.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Everything demo_scan reports is scoped to the demo's FIRST gamestate, because
// that is the only one demo_cut() addresses. This is not a theoretical
// distinction: real per-POV captures have been seen with two gamestates, whose
// server-time clock jumps backwards mid-file (1077875 -> 7625) when the level
// reloads; treating such a file as one continuous clock silently produces a
// negative span. Callers must check gamestate_count and refuse to cut when it
// is not 1. The normal capture path can only ever produce 1, so anything else
