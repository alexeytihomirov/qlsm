    resolve_preset_subdir() then resolves the builtin defaults to
    configs/presets/<name>/scripts -- a path that does not exist, because
    builtins live under configs/presets/_builtin/. The consequence is that
    _seed_draft()'s "copy the runtime-matched default preset in first, then
    overlay the source" branch is DEAD under `app`, while production always
    takes it. Every draft test therefore exercises "copy source, filter it",
    and production exercises "copy target default, overlay source, filter
    both" -- a different file set, which is where the over-strip of the
    target's own shipped plugins lived unseen.

    Deliberately a separate fixture rather than a change to `app`: ~1500 tests
    depend on `app` starting from an empty database, and several assert on
    preset rows they create themselves.
