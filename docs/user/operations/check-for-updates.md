# Check For Plugin Updates

QLSM ships a built-in set of minqlx plugins. When a new QLSM version fixes or adds a plugin, a host and its instances keep their existing copies until you update them. **Check for Updates** shows exactly which plugin files differ from the version QLSM ships, and lets you choose which ones to update.

The check itself changes nothing. Files are only replaced after you click **Update Selected**.

## Open The Check

1. Go to the **Servers** page.
2. Open the host row **Actions** menu.
3. Click **Check for Updates**.

The host must be **Active**. The check connects to the host, so it can take a few seconds.

## Read The Results

The modal has two kinds of sections.

**Common plugin pool.** This is the host's shared copy of QLSM's built-in plugins. Every instance on the host gets these files unless its own plugin set already includes a file with the same name.

**One box per instance.** These are the plugin files that belong to that instance, the same ones you see on its **Plugins** tab. A file is listed as **updated** when the instance has its own copy and QLSM ships a different version. Plugins the instance doesn't have its own copy of aren't listed, because the instance already gets them from the common plugin pool.

If everything already matches, the modal says **no updates available**.

## Choose What To Update

- **Common plugin pool** is ticked when it has changes.
- **Updated** files are ticked. Updating them replaces the instance's copy, **including any edits you made to that file in the plugin editor**. Untick a file you've customized and want to keep.
- **Restart to apply** is ticked for running instances. An instance only picks up plugin changes when it restarts, and only instances with at least one ticked file are restarted.

Click **Update Selected** to apply your choices.

## When Changes Take Effect

- **Instance files** take effect when the instance restarts. If you leave **restart to apply** unticked, they apply on the next manual or [scheduled restart](auto-restart.md).
- **The common plugin pool** refreshes on the host right away, but running instances don't restart for it. Each instance picks up the refreshed pool on its next restart.
- Stopped instances are never restarted. They use the updated files the next time you start them.

## Verification

1. Open [Host Logs](host-logs.md). A successful run logs **Common plugin pool refreshed.** and a **staged** line for each instance that received files.
2. If you restarted instances, wait for them to return to **Running**.
3. Run **Check for Updates** again. The files you updated should no longer be listed.

## If Something Goes Wrong

- **"Common pool check failed"** in the modal means QLSM couldn't read the host's plugin pool, usually because the host is unreachable. The per-instance results are still accurate, because QLSM reads those locally.
- If refreshing the common plugin pool fails, the host goes to **Error** and no instance files are changed. Check [Host Logs](host-logs.md) for the reason.
