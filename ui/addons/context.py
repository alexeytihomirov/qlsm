"""AddonContext -- the only surface an addon's backend.py talks to.

An addon never imports core modules directly if it can help it: everything it
is allowed to do goes through this object, which means core can change its
internals without breaking every installed addon, and the set of things an
addon *can* do stays readable in one file.

Addons run in-process with qlsm's full authority (DB, SSH keys, cloud API
key). This context is an ergonomics and consistency boundary, not a security
one -- see section 8.3 of the design spec. Nothing here should be mistaken for
a sandbox.
