"""The shared plugin pool, in two tiers per runtime.

- built-in: ql-assets/data/<runtime>-plugins/ -- ships inside the image and
  is only ever changed by a QLSM release. Read-only at runtime.
- operator: data/shared-plugins/<runtime>/ -- everything the operator pulls
  in from a plugin repository. `data/` is a bind mount shared by every
  container (web, workers, poller), so a download made by the web process
  is visible to the worker that later ships it to a host, and it survives
  an image update. Writing into ql-assets/ instead would land in the web
  container's own layer only, which is the bug this split fixes.

Every reader sees one merged view: the built-in files, overlaid by operator
files of the same name. Setup and Check for Updates push that merged view
to each host's /home/ql/assets/common/<runtime>-plugins/, and deploy
backfills it into every instance's plugin folder with `rsync
--ignore-existing`. So a root-level plugin in either tier is loadable by any
instance on that runtime, whether or not the instance's own scripts/
snapshot holds a copy. The config editor's Plugins tab lists these as
"shared" rows next to the draft's own files.
